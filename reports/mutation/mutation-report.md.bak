## ğŸ“Š Test Quality Analysis

Mutation testing validates the quality of our test suite by introducing deliberate bugs (mutations) and checking if tests catch them.


   - Suggestion: Test logical operator edge cases

3. **src/app/services/data.service.ts:156**
   - Mutation: String literal changed
   - Suggestion: Test error message content

## ğŸ’¡ Recommendations

1. **Focus on Survived Mutants**: Address the 6 survived mutants identified above
2. **Boundary Testing**: Add more tests for edge cases and boundary values
3. **Error Scenarios**: Improve testing of error handling paths
4. **Logical Operators**: Test complex logical conditions more thoroughly
5. **Regular Monitoring**: Run mutation tests regularly to maintain quality

## ğŸš€ Best Practices Achieved

- âœ… High mutation score (>90%)
- âœ… Comprehensive service testing
- âœ… Strong component test coverage
- âœ… Utility function validation
- âœ… Minimal survived mutants

## ğŸ“… Next Steps

1. **Weekly Reviews**: Analyze survived mutants weekly
2. **Threshold Enforcement**: Maintain >90% mutation score
3. **New Feature Testing**: Ensure new code has high mutation coverage
4. **Team Training**: Share mutation testing insights with team
